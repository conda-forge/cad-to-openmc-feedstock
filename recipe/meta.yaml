  summary: Package to automagically convert step-geometries to h5m descriptions for neutronics by OpenMC
  description: |
    CAD_to_OpenMC is a tool that converts CAD-geometries to DAGMC-geometries by means of surface meshing
    on a geometry in a step-file.
    DAGMC-geometries may be used in particles transport packages such as OpenMC.
    By default names used for parts in the CAD-geometry are used as material tags in the DAGMC-file, but this
    may be overridden.
